# AI Legal Document Assistant

## 1. App Name and Short Description
**AI Legal Document Assistant**  
An intelligent application designed to generate, critique, and validate legal documents using an agentic AI workflow and self-automation. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and LangChain for prompt-based document generation and iterative refinement.

## 2. Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **AI**: GPT-3.5 by OpenAI for document generation, critique, and validation
- **Libraries**:
  - `openai` for interacting with OpenAI's API
  - `langchain` for managing prompt templates and chains

---

## 3. Workflow

This application follows an **Agentic AI Workflow** that is self-automated to generate high-quality legal documents:

1. **User Input**:
   - The user specifies the type of legal document to generate.

2. **Initial Draft Generation**:
   - The application generates an initial draft using a predefined prompt.

3. **Critique and Revision Loop**:
   - The draft undergoes multiple iterations of critique and revision to improve its quality.

4. **Final Validation**:
   - The final document is validated to ensure it meets the required standards.

5. **Output**:
   - The validated document is presented to the user.

## 4. How to Run the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the Application**: 
  ```sh
   python legalpal.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**:
   Enter the type of legal document you want to generate when prompted.

4. **Future Development**

## 5. Suggested Enhancements:

1. Enhanced Prompts:

   - Improve the critique and validation prompts for better document quality.

2. User Interface:

   - Develop a web-based interface using frameworks like Streamlit or Flask.

3. Document Types:

   - Expand the range of legal documents that can be generated.

4. Feedback Loop:

   - Implement a feedback mechanism to learn from user inputs and improve document generation.
